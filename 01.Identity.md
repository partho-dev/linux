- In Linux, everything is either a file or a Folder
- Like how we have different kinds of users in Cloud Technology (AWS or GCP) 
    - AWS/GCP Root User Account 
    - IAM user Account
    - Service Account  (These accounts are used to make one service to authenticate with other services)

- In Linux also we have 3 kinds of user
    - root user and it is given an ID of `0` 
    - Service Accounts - These accounts are specifically for the Linux services like ssh, ftp, httpd etc and they are given the id as `1-999`
    - Normal user account - Humans & they are given the ID as - `1000+ - `

- Linux User Types
    - Root User
        - The superuser with `UID 0`. Has unrestricted access to the system.
        - Example: `root`.

    - System Accounts
        Used by services and system processes.
        UID range: `1-999` (in most distributions).
        Example: httpd, sshd, ftp.

    - Normal Users
        Created by administrators for human users.
        UID range: `1000+` (by default, configurable in `/etc/login.defs`).
        Example: partho.

## Authentication - Authentication Mechanisms in Linux

- Authentication (User Creation - `useradd`)
- In Cloud, we use IAM console to create users only and list them from the IAM>Users
- In Linux also, we use commands like 
    - create user - `useradd user_name`
    - Create password for that user - `passwd user_name`
        - and these users are listed in the file `/etc/passwd` [`IAM > Users`]
        - ![Linux-User-file](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/64be051d-46d5-4d95-863d-6d99274f3bb2)

        - Password info stored in - `/etc/shadow`
            - This file also contains the `password aging policy`
        - ![Linux-user-password](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7b5adbbf-0aca-4c0a-adc5-2a620ee7395e)

- modify any user & its properties - `usermod --help` = `usermod -c "He is a normal user" user_name`
    - Adding an expiration to the user account - `usermod -e "date" partho`

- We can Do a lot of administrator tasks using the `usermod` like
    - To disable the user to login, we can change its shell from `/bin/bash` to `/sbin/nologin` - `usermod -s /sbin/nologin partho`
    - To enable the user again, - `usermod -s /bin/bash partho`

- The user password policy etc can be controlled and make it a default in a file `/etc/login.def`
- The files & folders in `/etc/skel` gets automatically copied to the new user `/home/user_name` home directory

- So, its always good to set the password aging policy at `/etc/login.def` <- This gets applied to all the newly created users, already created users would have any effect
- rather manually doing for each user by typing `chage -m 7 -M 90 -W 7 partho`



## Authorisation - Authorization Mechanisms in Linux

- ![Linux-user-Authorisation](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c39690d2-1b09-4c34-b366-0a908e8c2ba7)

### Group Management

- ![Linux-Groups](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/04dd5fc3-769b-4eda-9e37-648fda60e568)

- Groups allow you to define sets of users who can share access to specific resources.
- Key commands: Create a group: `groupadd groupname`

- Add user to a group: `usermod -aG groupname username`
- View a user's groups: `groups username`
- Group permissions can be set on files, enabling collaborative access to shared resources.
- The Groups are stored in ``

### Sudo for Privileged Access
- The sudo system allows specific users to execute commands as other users (including root), based on defined policies.
- Example : The root user wants the user `partho` to manage the storage & the user `john` to manage the user management
- So, rather root shared the root password with both these users, root(admin) would update the `sodoers` file
- and provide the responsible user the authorisation to perform task `user MACHINE=COMMANDS`
    - root will open the sudoers file
    - identify the absolute path by executing `whereis useradd` & finds `useradd: /usr/sbin/useradd /usr/share/man/man8/useradd.8.gz`
    - So in the sudoers file it updates as `john ALL=/usr/sbin/useradd`

- Configuration: Edit the `sudoers` file using visudo: `visudo`
- Example entry:`username ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /path/to/command`
    - This allows username to execute /path/to/command without a password.

### File Permissions and Ownership
- Linux uses a straightforward model for controlling access to files:
    - `Owner`: The user who owns the file.
    - `Group`: The group that the file belongs to.
    - `Others`: All other users on the system.

- File permissions include:
    - `Read (r)`: Permission to view the file's content.
    - `Write (w)`: Permission to modify the file's content.
    - `Execute (x)`: Permission to execute the file as a program.

- Permissions are displayed as a string, e.g., `-rw-r--r--:`
    - `Owner: rw- (read, write)`
    - `Group: r-- (read-only)`
    - `Others: r-- (read-only)`

- Commands:Set Ownership: `chown username:groupname file`
- Set Permissions: `chmod 750 file`

### Access Control Lists (ACLs)
- ACLs provide more fine-grained control over file permissions, allowing you to define access for specific users or groups beyond the owner-group-others model.
- Example: Grant a user read and write permissions on a file: `setfacl -m u:username:rw file`
- View the ACLs for a file:`getfacl file`

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- For more complex authorization requirements, we can implement `RBAC` using tools like:
- a. `SELinux` (Security-Enhanced Linux): 
    - SELinux enforces mandatory access controls (MAC) based on policies.
    - Users and processes are assigned roles and domains, restricting what they can access or modify.
    - Example: Configure SELinux rules for services like HTTPD or SSHD.

- b. `AppArmor`: Similar to SELinux but simpler, AppArmor restricts applications using profiles.

### Centralized Authorization with LDAP
- If managing users across multiple systems, a centralized approach using LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) can be implemented.
- LDAP stores user and group information and integrates with PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules) for authentication and authorization.
- Practical Example: Authorization Workflow - Suppose you have a shared directory /data for a team:
- Create a Group: `groupadd teamgroup`

- Add Users to the Group: `usermod -aG teamgroup alice`
- `usermod -aG teamgroup bob`

- Set Ownership and Permissions:
```
    chown :teamgroup /data
    chmod 770 /data
```

- Use ACL for Specific Permissions: Allow a third user, charlie, read-only access:
    - `setfacl -m u:charlie:r /data`

- Comparison to AWS/GCP Authorization

|       Roles and   Policies (IAM/GCP)      	|      File Permissions,   Groups, ACLs, sudo     	|
|        Centralized   Access Control       	| LDAP or Active   Directory (for multiple hosts) 	|
| Fine-grained   Permission with Conditions 	|            ACLs, SELinux,   AppArmor            	|

---
Linux provides robust mechanisms for managing user authorization through file permissions, group-based access control, ACLs, and advanced tools like SELinux. These can be tailored to match your specific requirements for access control and security. Let me know if you'd like examples for any specific use case!
